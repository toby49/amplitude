# Amplitude Data Extraction Project

## Overview

This project extracts behavioral event data from **Amplitude**, our website analytics platform, and stores it in **Azure Blob Storage** for cheap and scalable storage. From here, we can transform the data and then analyse it in reporting tools like Tableau or Power BI, or even load into CRMs.
